## Codebase structure

The project has a simple structure, represented as bellow:

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >
   |
   |-- src/
   |    |-- data/
   |    |    |-- meta.json            # Provides META information 
   |    |    |-- app.json             # Provides APP information
   |    |
   |    |-- includes/                 # Page chunks, components
   |    |    |-- navigation.njk       # Top bar
   |    |    |-- sidebar.njk          # Left sidebar
   |    |    |-- scripts.njk          # JS scripts common to all pages
   |    |    |-- footer.njk           # The common footer
   |    |
   |    |-- layouts/                  # App Layouts (the master pages)
   |    |    |-- base.njk             # Used by common pages like index, UI
   |    |    |-- base-fullscreen.njk  # Used by auth pages (login, register)
   |    |   
   |    |-- index.njk                 # The default page
   |    |-- *.njk                     # All other pages provided by the UI Kit
   |

## Deploy a fork of this template to Netlify

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/app-generator/priv-eleventy-soft-ui-pro)

## CSS

Styling works with Sass. The main index file is in `src/static/assets/styles/main.scss`. Import any SCSS code you want in there; it will be processed and optimized. The output is in `dist/static/assets/styles/main.css`

## JS

Javascript can be written in ES6 syntax. The main index file is in `src/static/assets/scripts/main.js`. It will be transpiled to ES5 with babel, bundled together with webpack, and minified in production. The output is in `dist/static/assets/scripts/main.js`

## SVG Icons

All SVG files added to `src/static/assets/icons` will be bundled into a `symbol` sprite file. The SVG filename will then be used as the symbol identifier and the icon can be used as a shortcode.

For example, if you have a `github.svg` file in that folder, you can display it anywhere by using `{% icon "github" %}` in your templates.

## Critical CSS

Currently, critical CSS will only be inlined in the head of the homepage. This is done by using the [critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical) package in an automatic transform.
